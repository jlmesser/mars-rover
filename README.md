Incremental Kata - no peeping ahead!
This is an incremental kata to simulate a real business situation: work your way through the steps in order, but do not read the next requirement before you have finished your current one.

1. You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
2. The rover receives a character array of commands.
